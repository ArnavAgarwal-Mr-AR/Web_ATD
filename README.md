Code to detect stroke in a patient using machine learning, ensemble learning and deep learning models. 
We intended to create a web implication model to detect stroke in patient based on the input values.

Note: The code was initially written in Google Colab notebook and then the notebook was divided into parts and different code segments were divided into different files and then uploaded.
